# What happened in March 2023?

This month I delivered an MVP for my client. With a looming deadline, I had less desire to explore new technologies and more desire to further my knowledge of delivering chrome extensions and applications in general.

However, after delivering the app, I had more time and the month quickly changed its title to "trying new things".

- I wrote my first posts on my blog.
- I also created my first major pull request for an open source project other than my own.
- I made great progress in the JSNF course, and in understanding how `Nest.js` works.
- I went down a steep roller coaster hill for the first time, which did not end well for my thumb skin.

# In this month I have learned that...

1. Delivering chrome extension to production is quite different than delivering a web application. There is no server to deploy to. You have to upload the extension to the chrome store, and then wait for it to be approved. This can take a few days, and you can't make any changes to the extension while it is being reviewed. So it is very important to test your extension thoroughly before submitting it for review.
2. I have a very mixed feelings about `Nest.js`. In my opinion, it provides a clean, modular architecture that makes it easy to organize and scale applications. It also has a strong emphasis on testability and supports dependency injection, making it easier to write maintainable code.
   However, `Nest.js` is in my opinion overly prescriptive and opinionated in many of areas, which makes it more difficult to customize and adapt to specific use cases. Additionally, the learning curve for `Nest.js` is kinda steep. I feel there is a to much knowledge required to get started working with `Nest.js` for a custom project that isn't a simple CRUD.
3. Refinement meetings are my favorite SCRUM meetings. I feel they are the ones that allow the greatest speed gains in feater delivery/bug patching. It's a shame that in most of the projects I've participated in, they've been thrown off the calendar as the least important ones or not at all. If my next project does not include these meetings I will officially request their introduction. I feel that through these meetings, many views collide, the flow of knowledge is greater, and developers' fear of asking questions is reduced.
4. Open sourcing takes time. Firstly, it requires a thorough understanding of the project's goals, documentation, and coding conventions. Secondly, changes must be carefully considered to ensure they do not introduce bugs or regressions. Thirdly, open source projects often have strict guidelines for contributions, such as code reviews and pull requests. Lastly, collaboration with other contributors can lead to debates and delays in decision-making, adding to the time required for contributions.
5. [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) package is deprecated and it is better to use [dnd-kit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit)
6. A lot of things about backend and frontend connection from the [JSNF](https://www.jsnafrontach.pl/) course. I also learned about the [postgress](https://www.postgresql.org/) database and how to use it with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/).
7. I tried frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/). Out of these, I liked [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) the most. It is very easy to use and understand for React developers I think. I really like the concept of using signals instead of Virtual DOM. I hope this framework will be more popular in the future.
8. I kinda like writing blogposts, but it takes a lot of time. I hope I will get quicker at it couse if not I will not be able to write post every week.
9. If you type `behave as senior developer` to ChatGTP you will get better answers.
10. Listening to certain music that I associate mainly with work and with study makes it easier for me to start things that I would normally postpone. My favorite music for getting started is [Zelda Lofi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GdzrrWA8e7A)
