# Problem

In the [previous article](/blog/component-composition), I showed you how to avoid passing dozens of props to components using the **Compound Components** pattern. But we accured a few problems:

> - We added a new layer of abstraction that you need to remember and know exists. It would also be useful to document it.
> - We don't know exactly what components we should use in `Panel` if we want the whole component to look consistent and work properly. It would be useful to have some kind of syntax prompt that would tell us what we should use in `Panel`, right? :)
> - If we wanted components to be able to communicate with each other, e.g. when we clicked a button in `PanelHeader` we wanted to hide the whole `Panel` component, then we would have to pass additional props to the components (`handleClick`, `isPanelVisible`).

# Solution

## Compound components with React Context

Compound component is a pattern for creating reusable components that are composed of multiple smaller components.

In a compound component, the main parent component provides a set of child components that work together to implement the overall functionality of the parent component.

In previous article, we created a `Panel` component that looked like this:

```tsx
<Panel title="Panel">
  <PanelHeader>
    <h3>Header</h3>
  </PanelHeader>
  <PanelBody>
    <p>Body</p>
  </PanelBody>
</Panel>
```

First of all let's fix this issue:

> - We don't know exactly what components we should use in `Panel` if we want the whole component to look consistent and work properly. It would be useful to have some kind of syntax prompt that would tell us what we should use in `Panel`, right? :)

To do that we only need to follow this syntax in our `Panel` component:

```tsx
Panel.Header = function PanelHeader({ children }: ParentProps) {
  return <header>{children}</header>
}
```

So now all our `Panel.tsx` will look like these:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

interface PanelProps {
  title: string
}

interface ParentProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
}

export const Panel = ({ title, children }: PanelProps & ParentProps) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{title}</h1>
      {children}
    </div>
  )
}

Panel.Header = function PanelHeader({ children }: ParentProps) {
  return <header>{children}</header>
}

Panel.Body = function PanelHeader({ children }: ParentProps) {
  return <main>{children}</main>
}
```

Now when we enter `Panel.` in our editor and hit `CTRL + Space`, we should get a list of all the components that we can use in `Panel`.
Which allows us to use it like this:

```tsx
<Panel title="Panel">
  <Panel.Header>
    <h3>Header</h3>
  </Panel.Header>
  <Panel.Body>
    <p>Body</p>
  </Panel.Body>
</Panel>
```

It solves our first problem. Besides that this code is better documenting itself. In one file we have list of child components we should use inside `<Panel>` tags.

Let's move on to **second problem**:

> - If we wanted components to be able to communicate with each other, e.g. when we clicked a button in `PanelHeader` we wanted to hide the whole `Panel` component, then we would have to pass additional props to the components (`handleClick`, `isPanelVisible`).

So how to achieve this without overly adding props. With the help of React Context will come to us. If you don't yet know what React Context is, I recommend reading [this article](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) from new react documentation.

To begin with, we will define a `PanelContext` for our panel:

```tsx
interface PanelContextValue {
  isVisible: boolean
  showPanel: () => void
  hidePanel: () => void
}

const PanelContext = React.createContext({} as PanelContextValue)
```

In this context we will store data about whether the `Panel` is visible and two functions that will change the visibility of the panel.

The next thing to do will be to add state and `Provider` to the parent component `Panel`.

```tsx
export const Panel = ({ title, children }: PanelProps & ParentProps) => {
  const [isVisible, toggleVisibility] = React.useState(false)
  const showPanel = () => toggleVisibility(true)
  const hidePanel = () => toggleVisibility(false)

  if (!isVisible) return <button onClick={showPanel}>Show Panel</button>

  return (
    <PanelContext.Provider value={{ isVisible, showPanel, hidePanel }}>
      <div>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        {children}
      </div>
    </PanelContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

If the panel is not visible instead we will show a button that when clicked will show the panel. The last thing will be to use the values from the Provider in the child components.

Let's now rewrite `Panel.Header` so that it can hide the entire panel without passing props to this component:

```tsx
Panel.Header = function Header({ children }: ParentProps) {
  const { hidePanel } = useContext(PanelContext)
  return (
    <header>
      {children}
      <button onClick={hidePanel}>Hide Panel</button>
    </header>
  )
}
```

In this way we pass to the header the ability to change the state of the `Panel` component, leaving children as the only props. In a similar way, we can pass relevant functionality to other subcomponents.

The final `Panel.tsx` file now looks like this:

```tsx
import React from 'react'

interface PanelProps {
  title: string
}

interface ParentProps {
  children: React.ReactNode
}

interface PanelContextValue {
  isVisible: boolean
  showPanel: () => void
  hidePanel: () => void
}

const PanelContext = React.createContext({} as PanelContextValue)

export const Panel = ({ title, children }: PanelProps & ParentProps) => {
  const [isVisible, toggleVisibility] = React.useState(false)
  const showPanel = () => toggleVisibility(true)
  const hidePanel = () => toggleVisibility(false)

  if (!isVisible) return <button onClick={showPanel}>Show Panel</button>

  return (
    <PanelContext.Provider value={{ isVisible, showPanel, hidePanel }}>
      <div>
        <h1>{title}</h1>
        {children}
      </div>
    </PanelContext.Provider>
  )
}

Panel.Header = function Header({ children }: ParentProps) {
  const { hidePanel } = React.useContext(PanelContext)
  return (
    <header>
      {children}
      <button onClick={hidePanel}>Hide Panel</button>
    </header>
  )
}

Panel.Body = function Body({ children }: ParentProps) {
  return <main>{children}</main>
}
```

And its usage has not changed since the last code snippet even though we added new functionality:

```tsx
<Panel title="Panel">
  <Panel.Header>
    <h3>Header</h3>
  </Panel.Header>
  <Panel.Body>
    <p>Body</p>
  </Panel.Body>
</Panel>
```

That's all. I hope you enjoyed this article. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments.

## What is compound component?

**Compound component** A compound component is a component that is made up of multiple sub-components. The sub-components are typically combined together in order to create a more complex component that performs a more complex function.

Example:

```tsx
<Panel title="Panel">
  <Panel.Header>
    <h3>Header</h3>
  </Panel.Header>
  <Panel.Body>
    <p>Body</p>
  </Panel.Body>
</Panel>
```
